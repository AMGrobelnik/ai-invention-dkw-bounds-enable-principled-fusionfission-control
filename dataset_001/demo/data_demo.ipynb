    "\n",
    "### How to use this notebook:\n",
    "1. **Self-contained**: This notebook runs without any external files or dependencies\n",
    "2. **Customizable**: Modify the `simulated_dataset` to test with your own questions\n",
    "3. **Extensible**: Add new fields to the output format by modifying the `collect_data()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Original vs Notebook differences:\n",
    "- **Original**: Loads data from HuggingFace datasets library\n",
    "- **Notebook**: Uses inline sample data for demonstration\n",
    "- **Original**: Saves output to `data_out.json` file  \n",
    "- **Notebook**: Displays output directly in cells\n",
    "\n",
    "### To restore original functionality:\n",
    "1. Install dependencies: `pip install datasets`\n",
    "2. Replace `simulated_dataset` with: `load_dataset(\"gsm8k\", \"main\", split=\"test[:200]\")`\n",
    "3. Uncomment the file writing code to save to `data_out.json`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty Metric:\n",
    "The current difficulty calculation (`len(question) / 100`) is a simple proxy. You could enhance this with:\n",
    "- Word count-based metrics\n",
    "- Mathematical complexity analysis\n",
    "- Machine learning-based difficulty prediction"
