    "\n",
    "This notebook is completely self-contained and can be run without any external files or dependencies (except for the `datasets` library if you want to use the original `collect_data()` function).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Changes from Original Script:\n",
    "- **Inlined JSON data**: The sample data is now embedded as a Python list instead of being read from an external JSON file\n",
    "- **Interactive exploration**: Added analysis and visualization of the dataset\n",
    "- **Self-contained**: No external file dependencies for the demo\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Modify:\n",
    "1. **Use real data**: Uncomment and run `data = collect_data()` to fetch from HuggingFace\n",
    "2. **Add more examples**: Extend the `sample_dataset` list with additional examples\n",
    "3. **Change difficulty calculation**: Modify the difficulty formula in the `collect_data()` function\n",
    "4. **Export results**: Save `collected_data` to a file using `json.dump()` if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Original Artifact:\n",
    "- **ID**: dataset_001\n",
    "- **Name**: data.py\n",
    "- **Purpose**: DKW benchmark dataset collection"
