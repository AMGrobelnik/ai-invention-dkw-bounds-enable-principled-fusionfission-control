Uncomment the `datasets` import and `load_dataset` call in the `collect_data()` function\n2. Replace the `simulated_examples` with actual dataset loading\n3. Ensure you have the `datasets` library installed: `pip install datasets`\n\n### To modify difficulty calculation:\n- The current difficulty is based on question length (`len(question) / 100`)\n- You could implement more sophisticated metrics like:\n  - Number of mathematical operations\n  - Presence of specific keywords\n  - Answer complexity\n\n### To add more data processing:\n- Add data validation\n- Implement filtering based on difficulty thresholds\n- Add data cleaning steps\n- Include additional metadata fields",
