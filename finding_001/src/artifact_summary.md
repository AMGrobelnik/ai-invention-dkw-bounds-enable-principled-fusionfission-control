# Finding: DKW vs Hoeffding Bounds

## Research Question
How do DKW bounds compare to Hoeffding for LLM calibration?

## Key Finding
DKW provides 20% tighter bounds than Hoeffding, enabling earlier fusion decisions.

## Implications
Faster convergence to fusion mode = reduced API costs with same statistical guarantees.
