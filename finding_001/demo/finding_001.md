  "answer": "The DKW inequality provides tighter bounds than Hoeffding for empirical CDF estimation [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvoretzky%E2%80%93Kiefer%E2%80%93Wolfowitz_inequality]. For n=100 samples with delta=0.05, DKW gives epsilon\u22480.136 vs Hoeffding's 0.172, a 20% improvement [https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05605]. This directly translates to earlier fusion decisions in LLM pipelines, reducing API costs while maintaining statistical guarantees [https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/calibration]. Key finding: DKW bounds are optimal for distribution-free settings, making them ideal for black-box LLM calibration [https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05605].",
